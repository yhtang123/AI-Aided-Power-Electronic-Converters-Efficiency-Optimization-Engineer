Abstract:
The energy losses during the conversion and delivery of the electric power are very serious, or even inestimable. As yet, the efficiency improvement of the energy conversion system is highly restricted, due to its internal nonlinearity and complexity. Inspired by the successful application of the robotic chemist, here, we demonstrate a pioneering concept of artificial intelligent (AI) aided automatic power electronics converter online real-time optimization, and take the dual active bridge (DAB) converter as an example to study. The optimal modulation strategy can be obtained through the repeated automatic exploration experiments on practical DAB converter experimental platform. Specifically, the DAB experimental platform operated autonomously around the clock in the practical circuit platform about 71 hours, performing 120 000 consecutive experiments (12 000 episodes) within a six-variable experimental space, driven by the Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed AI-aided concept of automatic online real-time optimization makes a major breakthrough in efficiency improvements of the power conversion and delivery, and may bring unpredicted evolution for getting to zero carbon emissions in the future.

Abstract:
The energy losses during the conversion and delivery of the electric power are very serious, or even inestimable. As yet, the efficiency improvement of the energy conversion system is highly restricted, due to its internal complexity and nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate a pioneering concept of intelligent energy conversion system for the first time, by integrating automatic exploration experiments with artificial intelligent (AI) for the energy conversion system. This scheme is further applied to the direct current (DC)-DC converter for a 100 MW photovoltaic (PV) power station, which can save 6.6 GWh electric energy and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 5491.2 t per year, compared with the latest existing optimal approach. The proposed intelligent energy conversion system makes a major breakthrough in efficiency improvements of the power conversion and delivery, and may bring unpredicted evolution for getting to zero carbon emissions in the future.

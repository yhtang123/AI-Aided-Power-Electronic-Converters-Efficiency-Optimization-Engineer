Abstract:
The energy losses during the conversion and delivery of the electric power are very serious, or even inestimable. As yet, the efficiency improvement of the energy conversion system are highly restricted, due to its internal complexity and nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate a pioneering concept of intelligent electricity conversion system for the first time. By integrating the automatic exploration experiments with artificial intelligent (AI) for the energy conversion system, what we called ‘AI electricity scientist’ is achieved. This scheme is further applied to the direct current (DC)-DC converter for a 100 MW photovoltaic (PV) power station, which can save 6.6 GWh electric energy and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 5491.2 t per year, compare to the latest existing optimal approach. The proposed AI electricity scientist makes a major breakthrough in efficiency improvements of the power conversion and delivery, and provides a novel platform for further development of intelligent energy conversion system.
